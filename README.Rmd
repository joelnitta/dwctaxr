The goal of dwctaxon is to facilitate working with [Darwin Core Taxon data](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#taxon) in R.

The typical use-case of dwctaxon is not create Darwin Core Taxon datasets from scratch (although you could do that), but rather to enable easy modification and validation of existing datasets.

The primary motivation for validation is so that the dataset can be used for taxonomic name resolution, for example with the [taxastand](https://github.com/joelnitta/taxastand) R package.

## Installation

`dwctaxon` can be installed from [r-universe](https://joelnitta.r-universe.dev) or [github](https://github.com/joelnitta).

``` r
install.packages("dwctaxon", repos = 'https://joelnitta.r-universe.dev')
```

OR

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("joelnitta/dwctaxon")
```


## Usage

First, load packages and a dataset to work with:

```{r load-pkg-data}
library(taxastand)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(dwctaxon)

filmy_taxonomy
```

`filmy_taxonomy` is a taxonomic dataset of filmy ferns included in the `taxastand` package.

All functions in the `dwctaxon` package start with `dct_`.

### Validate taxonomy

```{r validate, error = TRUE}
# Data not meeting Darwin Core Taxon standards will error
dct_validate(filmy_taxonomy)
```

### Fix taxonomy

```{r fix}
filmy_taxonomy_fixed <- dct_fix_format(filmy_taxonomy)

# Now the validation passes
dct_validate(filmy_taxonomy_fixed)
```

### Add rows

```{r add-row}
filmy_taxonomy_fixed |>
  dct_add_row(sci_name = "Hymenophyllum dwctaxonense Nitta", taxonomicStatus = "accepted") |>
  # The new row is added at the end. Slice to that so we can see it.
  slice_tail(n = 1) |>
  select(taxonID, taxonomicStatus, scientificName, modified)
```

### Change status

```{r change-status}
filmy_taxonomy_fixed |>
  # The modified entry is 'taxonomicStatus' of the second row. Slice to that so we can see it.
  dct_change_status(taxon_id = "54133783", new_status = "accepted") |>
  slice_head(n = 2) |>
  select(taxonID, taxonomicStatus, scientificName, modified)
```

### Piping

All the functions in dwctaxon take a dataframe as their first argument, so they are "pipe-friendly" and can be chained together:

```{r pipe}
filmy_taxonomy |>
  dct_fix_format() |>
  dct_change_status(taxon_id = "54133783", new_status = "accepted") |>
  dct_add_row(sci_name = "Hymenophyllum dwctaxonense Nitta", taxonomicStatus = "accepted") |>
  dct_validate()
```

It's often a good idea to include `dct_validate()` to make sure the modified taxonomic database is still correctly formatted.
